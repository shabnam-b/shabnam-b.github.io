    abstract = "Cross-lingual annotation projection is a practical method for improving performance on low resource structured prediction tasks. An important step in annotation projection is obtaining alignments between the source and target texts, which enables the mapping of annotations across the texts. By manually correcting automatically generated alignments, we examine the impact of alignment quality{---}automatic, manual, and mixed{---}on downstream performance for two information extraction tasks and quantify the trade-off between annotation effort and model performance.",
